# Image Color Pallete Generator
Using Flask, I have developed a web application that allows users to upload an image and instantly obtain the color codes of the ten most prominent colors present in the image. By leveraging image processing techniques and sophisticated algorithms, this application provides users with a convenient way to extract and explore color palettes from their favorite images. Whether you're a designer seeking inspiration or simply curious about the color composition of an image, this tool offers a seamless and intuitive solution.
